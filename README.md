# Signature-Authentication-System

A **multi-class CNN system** that does more than just detect forgeryâ€”it can **identify the signer** of a handwritten signature and classify it as **Genuine** or **Forged**. This project achieved **89% accuracy** on the test dataset and demonstrates the power of deep learning in **signature authentication**.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Dual Classification:** Predicts both the signer and the authenticity of a signature.
- **Lightweight Repository:** Only notebook, metadata, dataset link, and UI screenshot are included.
- **Reproducible:** Easy to run your own experiments using the provided notebook.
- **Visual Reference:** UI screenshot included for a clear understanding of the interface.
- **Scalable:** Can be extended to larger datasets or integrated into authentication systems.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

Signatures are widely used for authentication, but **forgeries are common**. This project solves two problems simultaneously:

1. **Identify the signer** â€“ Multi-class classification using CNN to predict the person who made the signature.
2. **Detect forgery** â€“ Binary classification to determine if the signature is genuine or forged.

**Workflow:**

1. Preprocess the signature images (resize, normalize, grayscale).  
2. Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with dual outputs.  
   - Output 1: Person identification (multi-class).  
   - Output 2: Forgery detection (binary).  
3. Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics for both tasks.  
4. Demonstrate predictions using a sample **UI**.

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

The dataset contains multiple handwritten signatures per person. Only a **link to the dataset** is provided here to keep the repository lightweight:

[Download Dataset][(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matteocarnebella/cedar-signatures)] 

After downloading, place the dataset in your preferred folder and update paths in the notebook.  

**metadata.csv** maps numeric person IDs to actual names, so your predictions are human-readable.
